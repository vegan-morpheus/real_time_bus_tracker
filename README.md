# Real Time Bus Tracker

This is an example of a refactored version of a project for MIT's "Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN" course. It utilizes the MapBox GL JS client-side JavaScript library.

When you click the "Show stops between MIT and Harvar" button the marker will update and move on its own. I also added the ability to see 3D buildings when you zoom in and navitgation controls on the top right corner for zooming in and out of the map and rotating the map. I found the code for these features that I added from the Mapbox Documentation.
